Due to datalimitations, job quality rankings could be generated only for jobs accounting for around 90% of EU employment.In Germany and the Netherlands, the five big occupational classes account for a small proportion of overall inequality, and wage inequality within working class occupations is particularly high.Core employment has accounted for much of the recent growth across the wage distribution, although still with an upgrading skew towards higher-paid jobs.Manufacturing employment is upgrading: the employment lost mainly in mid-paying jobs up to 2013 is being replaced by higher-skilled and higher-paying employment.But this is hardly a new or exciting finding since occupational wage differentials just reproduce the European distribution of wage inequality.Since different occupations involve different types of tasks, this could lead to systematic wage differentials between occupations that cannot be reduced to differences in the stock of human capital.As already discussed in the report, Figure A5 shows that the between-jobs component of wage inequality is much more stable than inequality within jobs.Well-paid jobs have added employment even during the peak crisis period (2008–2010) and contribute disproportionately in all periods to overall employment growth.In fact, between-job wage differentials tend to be positively correlated with job quality: jobs with bad working conditions tend to also have lower wages and vice versa.Since most of the studies on occupational wages use surveys, they may miss a significant part of the growth in wage inequality.This may affect the status and social power associated with the occupations and may end up reinforcing the inequality that initially generated the segregation, further expanding occupational wage differentials.Occupations play a significant role in shaping wage inequality and not just by grouping workers with similar levels of human capital.So, even if occupations are expected to play a significant role in structuring wage inequality in most developed economies, the importance of such a role is likely to vary.In the nine European countries analysed in the previous pages, occupations account for a similar level of overall wage inequality, between 40% and 50%.Around 60% of top-quintile employment growth in the EU since 2013 occurred in these three Member States; they also accounted for around half of total net employment growth.The percentage of variance explained by jobs in wage inequality is 44% in 2010, very similar to the value of 40% estimated earlier using SES data for Spain.Whereas occupation only accounts for a growing share of wage inequality over the period, the combination of occupation and sector shows a clear decline over time.Employment growth since 2013 has been only modestly skewed towards well-paid jobs; growth has been robust in low-paid and mid-paid jobs too.Other unambiguously upgrading countries included Sweden (2011–2016) and Portugal (2013–2016).In Belgium, employment growth was polarised in bothperiods (2011–2013 and 2013–2016), occurring only in the top and bottom wage quintiles.As the recovery in EU labour markets has broadened since 2013, a (very modestly) growing share of net new employment has been in core employment status.Can the countries be somehow grouped in different categories or models with respect to how occupations structure wage inequality?For instance, Weeden et al (2007) found that most of the growth of wage inequality in the USA between 1973 and 2005 took place between rather than within occupations.In mainstream economics, occupations have traditionally played a secondary role as explanatory factors, with skills differentials being the prime explanation for wage inequality.This approach accounts for a significant amount of the total wage variance over the period, although it is far below the results for jobs(approximately two or three times lower).This is partly because occupations mediate the effect on wage inequality of other factors such as human capital, social class and segregation by gender or age.The observed association between levels of education and occupational wage differentials may be the result of credentialism and occupational closure, rather than productivity differentials.It finds that occupations have their own effect on wage inequality as well as mediating other factors such as human capital and social class.For instance, the sociologists Kimand Sakamoto (2008) studied the period between 1983 and 2002 in the USA, finding no evidence of an increasing role for occupations in wage inequality.There could be both job polarisation (or upgrading) and growing wage inequality without any significant link between the two phenomena.Since different occupations typically require different amounts of human capital, it could be associated with systematic wage differentials.
